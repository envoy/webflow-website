# This GitHub Action workflow automates the process of incrementing a version number stored in a .version file
# every time a push is made to the main branch. It performs the following steps:
# 1. Checks out the repository code.
# 2. Reads the current version from the .version file and increments it.
# 3. Commits the updated .version file back to the main branch.
# 4. Creates a new git tag with the incremented version number.
# 5. Pushes the new tag to the remote repository.

# To deploy a new version of code all you have to do is push to the main branch.
# The version number will be incremented and a new tag will be created and pushed to the remote repository.
# Then, in GitHub Releases, you can create a new release based on the tag that was just created.
# Finally, update the CDN script (jsDelivr) to point to the new version number.
